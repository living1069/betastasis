% PIPELINE INTRODUCTION
%
%    The genetic analysis pipeline provides an integrated environment for the
%    analysis and interpretation of biological data. It consists of four main
%    components:
%    - organism reference
%    - sample query system
%    - biological ontologies
%    - computational analysis tools 
%
%    The organism reference contains biological consensus data for a particular
%    organism such as Homo sapiens. All knowledge about the currently selected
%    organism is stored in the global variable "organism". You can get more
%    information about the organism reference by typing HELP ORGANISM.
%
%    The sample query system provides access to local and remote dataset
%    repositories and metadata. The system can be used for retrieving and
%    filtering large collections of biological measurements. You can get more
%    information about this subsystem by typing HELP QUERY.
%
%    The pipeline also contains a number of builtin ontologies, such as
%    Gene Ontology, MSigDB, OMIM, etc. It also has its own ontologies for
%    describing things such as sequencing and microarray platforms. You can
%    get more information about the available ontologies by typing
%    HELP ONTOLOGIES.
%
%    Finally, the pipeline contains a large number of data analysis tools in
%    an easily executable format. To get an overview about the available tools,
%    you can type HELP MICROARRAY or HELP SEQUENCING.
